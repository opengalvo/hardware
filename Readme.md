# Welcome to the openGalvo project

## openGalvo Shield Rev. 2.0

Intension was to develop a shield which provides enough possibilities to develop hobby machines and applications for laser, e.g. SLA printer or laser etching.

### Features:

* Based on a Teensy 3.6 MCU
* 16 bit DAC
* DAC is easy to control by just setting the voltage on a channel (X/Y axis)
* Support for 3 endstops
* Pololu driver for Z-axis (upgrade to TMC2130 planned)
* Comes with small example code


### How to build

You can either use the Eagle files to create the PCP by yourself, send the Gerber files to your favorite PCB builder or order a PCB (naked, without parts or with soldered parts ready to use with your Teensy 3.6) from us. 
For ordering the PCB instructions will be published at a later time
